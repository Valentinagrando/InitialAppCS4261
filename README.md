## Concept:
Moody is a one-instance mood reflection app. When you log-in, you will be able to touch in any day of the month and categorize it as "Good", "Meh", or "Bad".
You should label as many days as you can remember! Once your sign-out, the data from the calendar disappears but we save your last entered mood! 
That way, next time you sign-in again, you are able to reflect on the month like on a blank slate. 
This strategy was adopted as a coping mechanism. Moody wants to be a source of sentiment processing for anyone, so that all those feelings trapped inside can have an outlet.
Furthermore, but erasing the data each sign-in, Moody gives you a chance to give a previous "Meh" day, for example, a "Good" rating in case you realized you had more to be thanksful for on that day!
The reverse is also fair, no one has all good days! And that's okay!
